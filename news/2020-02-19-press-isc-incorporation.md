### Press Release: Incorporation of the InnerSource Commons Foundation

The InnerSource Commons Foundation (ISC) was incorporated on February 19th, 2020 and filed an application to become a 501(c)3 public charity.

The mission of the ISC is to establish a body of knowledge and to educate individuals, commercial and non-profit organizations, research centers, and other institutions about the successful adoption of InnerSource best practices. The ISC provides a safe environment for accumulating and sharing knowledge and experiences, finding best practices, building standards and tooling, producing educational materials, and fostering research to advance the understanding, adoption, and practice of InnerSource.

The entirety of the ISC is handled transparently and openly. To protect the identity of contributing individuals and organizations, discussions are held under the Chatham House Rule: Participants can share all learnings and insights, but must not attribute them unless the originator wishes so. Documentation, teaching materials, best practices patterns, and others are made available under open licenses that support this goal.

The initial board of directors is comprised of:
* Danese Cooper (as President)
* Georg Grütter (as Vice-President)
* Russell Rutledge (as Secretary)
* Cedric Williams (as Treasurer)
* Silona Irene Bonewald
* Maximilian Capraro
* Daniel Izquierdo Cortázar
* Isabel Drost-Fromm
* Timothy H-J. Yao

Future boards will be elected by the membership on a yearly basis. ISC initially is incorporated in the US. As the community grows, we anticipate to found sister organizations in the European Union, Latin America, and other parts of the world.

Membership in the InnerSource Commons foundation is purely merit-based, free of any cost, and restricted to individuals. Though there will not be any membership fees, the InnerSource Commons Foundation welcomes sponsor contributions. These are tax deductible in the US.

It is easy to get involved, learn about InnerSource and contribute to the InnerSource Commons: Check out [innersourcecommons.org](https://innersourcecommons.org) for more information!
