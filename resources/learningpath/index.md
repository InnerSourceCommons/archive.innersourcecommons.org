The InnerSource Commons Learning Path community is focused on creating a set of resources explaining and teaching various aspects of InnerSource. This curated set of videos and articles cover patterns that have been adopted by many organisations and have been proven to lead to successful InnerSource practices. The video production was kindly sponsored by PayPal.
 
Many of our community use these resources within their organisations to increase awareness and build competencies around InnerSource.
 
We hope they help you on your journey to InnerSource!
 
The InnerSource Learning Path covers the following sections:

### [Introduction]

Check out the Introduction to learn about the types of problems where InnerSource can help, how to do it, the types of benefits you can expect to see by participating, and the underlying principles that make it all work.
