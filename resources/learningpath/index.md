The InnerSource Learning Path is a series of short videos and articles explaining and teaching various aspects of inner source.
Their production was kindly sponsored by PayPal. The Learning Path section introducing InnerSource is already shot and hosted in the O'Reilly Safari platform at [http://bit.ly/inner-source-learning-path].

Once finished, the first edition of the InnerSource Learning Path will cover the following sections:

1. [Introduction]
1. [Product Owner]
1. [Trusted Committer]
1. Contributor *(coming soon...)*

The videos are becoming available on YouTube part by part.
