The InnerSource Commons Learning Path community is focused on creating a set of resources explaining and teaching various aspects of InnerSource. This curated set of videos and articles cover patterns that have been adopted by many organisations and have been proven to lead to successful InnerSource practices. The video production was kindly sponsored by PayPal.
 
Many of our community use these resources within their organisations to increase awareness and build competencies around InnerSource.
 
We hope they help you on your journey to InnerSource!
 
The InnerSource Learning Path covers the following sections:
