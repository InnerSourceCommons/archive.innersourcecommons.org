Back when Bosch started with InnerSource, there was not enough technical, legal, collaboration, social, and commercial experience within Bosch to start open source right away. Getting an InnerSource initiative off the ground in such a setting is challenging. Stefan will go back to the origins of InnerSource at Bosch and share the surprising story of how he managed convince upper management to engage in InnerSource using rather unconventional means.

And while a lot of the best practices for API products are also applicable to private APIs, there are significant differences in the circumstances and trade-offs they need to make. The most important difference is probably in their budgets: as potential profit centers, API products can afford to invest a lot more money in documentation and UX driven developer portal improvements. Internal APIs rarely have that luxury. In this talk I will explain the differences between public and private APIs, introduce upstream developer experience, and explain how it can improve downstream DX. Introduce experience design (a.k.a. gamification), and describe how it could be used on internal developer portals. Lastly I will talk about the importance of SDKs and the different strategies an organisation can take to build them, including an innersourcing strategy that could help to improve the DX of APIs at the heart of your organisation's digital transformation initiative.</div>&lt;/tr&gt;<tr><td class="author"><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#georg_gruetter">Georg Gr&uuml;tter <span class="affiliation">(Robert Bosch)</span>&lt;/td&gt;<td class="title">Bosch Internal Open Source - Empowering Fellow Engineers with APIs <span onclick="toggleAbstract('gruetter-2')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="gruetter-2-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="gruetter-2"> FusionX was the first Bosch Internal Open Source Community and has been active for the past 9 years.

So far we collected development activity information from over 450,000 open source projects to quantify their performance and predict their success. From the best projects, we plan to mine the used process and practices.

Metrics are not the panacea, but help to understand the current structure and methodology followed by a software development team. And how far this is from other similar organizations.

To better understand IS, researchers and practitioners need to measure IS collaboration. However, there is no established method yet for doing so. In this talk, we present a method for measuring IS collaboration by measuring the patch-flow within an organization. Patch-flow is the flow of code contributions across organizational boundaries such as project, organizational unit, or profit center boundaries. We demonstrate the capability of the patch-flow measurement method by applying it at a software developing company. In this company, we found that about half (47.9%) of all code contributions to IS projects constitute patch-flow between organizational units, almost all (42.2%) being between organizational units working on different products. Such significant patch-flow indicates high relevance of the patch-flow phenomenon. Our patch-flow measurement method is the first of its kind to measure and quantify IS collaboration. It can serve as a base for further quantitative analyses of IS collaboration.</div><tr><td class="time">17:30 - 17:45<td colspan="2">Closing<tr><td class="time">19:00 - 22:00<td colspan="2">Social Event &lt;/table&gt;<table class="schedule"><tr><td colspan="3"><h3>Thursday, May 17th</h3><tr><td class="time">09:00 - 09:15<td colspan="2"> Opening<tr><td class="time">09:15 - 10:00<td class="author"><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#lauri_apple">Lauri Apple</a> <span class="affiliation">Workday</span><td class="title"><span class="keynoteTag">Keynote:</span> Building Trust with Intentional Relationship Design <span onclick="toggleAbstract('apple-1')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="apple-1-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="apple-1"> Disagreements and misunderstandings are common even in the most high-performing organizations.

In addition to this, it is expected to open some discussion around the topic of this type of models that are usually initiated as a set of good practices, but at the end they are seen as pure bureaocracy within organizations.</div><tr><td class="time">15:00 - 15:15<td colspan="2">Closing<tr><td class="time">15:20 - 19:00<td colspan="2">Special Event &lt;/table&gt;<table class="schedule"><tr><td colspan="3"><h3>Friday, May 18th</h3><tr><td class="time">09:00 - 09:15<td colspan="2"> Opening<tr><td class="time">09:15 - 10:00<td class="author"><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#karsten_gerloff">Karsten Gerloff</a> <span class="affiliation">(Siemens)</span><td class="title"><span class="keynoteTag">Keynote: </span>Karsten Gerloff: Committing (to) change: The Siemens Software Management System <span onclick="toggleAbstract('gerloff-1')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="gerloff-1-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="gerloff-1"> The Siemens Inner Source platform started as a way for one division to maintain a standard stack across its product range. From these beginnings, it quickly grew into something much bigger: A state-of-the-art development environment, a tool to build platforms within the company. It also became a highly visible example for a collaborative, agile way of working within Siemens. In this keynote, we will review the platform´s history and the key reasons for its success so far, as well as challenges past and present.</div><tr><td class="time">10:00 - 10:30<td colspan="2">Coffee Break<tr><td class="time">10:30 - 11:00<td class="author"><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#robert_hansel">Robert Hansel</a> <span class="affiliation">(Robert Bosch)</span><td class="title">Hack Your Desktop - An InnerSource Approach For The Developer Desktop at Bosch <span onclick="toggleAbstract('hansel-1')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="hansel-1-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="hansel-1"> InnerSource - what we call Bosch Internal Open Source (BIOS) internally - is a great tool for a variety of use cases in a corporate setup. One of them being internal tooling were we think InnerSource is quite a natural fit. Thanks to our constant efforts of pushing BIOS forward over the last nine years we're finally able to convince the corporate sector IT at Bosch to start the adoption of InnerSource. The first internal tool which will become a BIOS project is the so-called Open Source Desktop (OSD), a Linux based OS altenative for Bosch associates. Apart from providing details on the first steps we took, we will also give some insights on the preconditions which are key for a successful InnerSource project and give a brief overview about the areas where OSD is used within Bosch.</div><tr><td class="time">11:00 - 12:00<td><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#erin_bank">Erin Bank</a> <span class="affiliation">(CA Technologies)</span><td class="title">InnerSource Patterns (Part 2): Together we can build the roadmap for success! <span onclick="toggleAbstract('bank-3')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="bank-3-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="bank-3"> Those of us establishing InnerSource programs encounter similar problems.

For the senior management, it is a R&amp;D Efficiency program. For developers, it is an opportunity to express themselves. The journey had its share of successes and failures that made us to do several course corrections on the way. Soon the fantasy of inner sourcing/reuse and the expectations of delivering on the corporate targets had its own ways of coming together. The honey moon was soon over and we had the onerous task of making that heady cocktail, just the right mix between the open source dare and the corporate flair. We are still looking for that elusive mix… This talk will explore the things that worked, things that didn't, people aspirations, frustrations</div><tr><td class="time">13:45 - 14:15<td><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#maximilian_capraro">Maximilian Capraro</a> <span class="affiliation">(FAU Erlangen)</span><td class="title">A Classification Framework for InnerSource Projects and Programs <span onclick="toggleAbstract('capraro-2')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="capraro-2-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="capraro-2"> In open source, projects often differ significantly from one another. Consequently, it is no surprise that inner source projects and even programs can have a variety of different shapes as well. When adopting inner source by founding a new inner source program, or even when managing the evolution of an existing initiative, it is crucial to understand what different shapes (classes) of inner source projects and programs exist. In this talk, we present a classification framework laying out different classes of inner source projects and programs. We apply the framework to eleven companies doing IS and discuss differences of their inner source programs. The presented classification framework is the first of its kind to classify and structure the space of existing inner source program. After hearing this talk, you will be able to apply the framework to your own company.</div><tr><td class="time">14:15 - 14:45<td><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#israel_herraiz">Israel Herraiz</a> <span class="affiliation">(BBVA)</span><td class="title">Notebooks are not enough: How InnerSource Can Make Data Science Better <span onclick="toggleAbstract('herraiz-1')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="herraiz-1-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="herraiz-1"> Data scientists are not developers. And yet, they are constantly writing source code. Writing software is complex, even more so in the domain of data science. Software Engineering is the reification of decades of failures and successes on delivering software products. Perhaps open source is one of the most paradigmatic cases: with innovative practices, we have seen how globally distributed teams, mixtures of paid and volunteer developers, reusing tens of pieces of code, have been consistently delivering high quality software. What can data science learn from Software Engineering and Open Source? In this talk, we will show how data science teams can learn from Software Engineering and Open Source, to embrace an Inner Source approach, to reuse code and results and to deliver high quality results, that are easier to promote to production.</div><tr><td class="time">14:45 - 15:15<td colspan="2">Coffe Break<tr><td class="time">15:15 - 15:45<td class="author"> <a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#johannes_nicolai">Johannes Nicolai</a> <span class="affiliation">(GitHub)</span><br /> <a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#marko_berkovic">Marko Berkovic</a> <span class="affiliation">(GitHub)</span><td class="title">Inner Source Success Metrics that satisfy upper management and do not frustrate developers <span onclick="toggleAbstract('nicolai-1')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="nicolai-1-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="nicolai-1"> Everybody can install a software forge, prescribe that "we are doing inner source now" and call it a success by definition. Many go a step further and even start to measure metrics about its effectiveness. Metrics are tricky though, they often just frustrate developers, are easy to game and very rarely tie back to anything the business understands - cyclomatic complexity and KLOC anyone? This talk will propose some metrics used by a venture capital fund that manages companies like Docker, Twitter, Blabla Car and Hello Fresh to measure the success of their investments. We will show the economic impact of those metrics on concrete examples of their application at large companies like Allianz, Continental and Zalando. As many of those metrics have to do with the application of inner source (open source in the boundaries of enterprises), we will also demystify the probably greatest misperception about inner source which is hampering especially middle management to adopt it – the fear that every developer from now on just does whatever he or she wants.</div><tr><td class="time">15:45 - 16:30<td class="author"><a href="/events/isc-spring-2018-speakers#russel_rutledge">Russ Rutledge</a> <span class="affiliation">(Nike)</span><td class="title">An Oriole for InnerSource <span onclick="toggleAbstract('rutledge-2')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="rutledge-2-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span><div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="rutledge-2"> Inner source is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software.

This presentation introduces the key terms, concepts, and principles for effective inner sourcing along with explanations and real examples. It is content that is accessible to newcomers while at the same time refreshing to those with experience. The same information in this presentation is also delivered as an O’Reilly Oriole, available freely at https://www.safaribooksonline.com/oriole/. We’ll review the Oriole, how to use it, and other Orioles related to inner source that are on the way.</div><tr><td class="time">16:30 - 17:15<td colspan="2">Closing &lt;/table&gt;</table></table></a></a></a></a></a></table></article></div></div><div id="up-to-top" class="row"><div class="small-12 columns" style="text-align: right;"> <a class="iconfont" href="#top-of-page" data-proofer-ignore>&#xf108;</a></div></div><footer id="footer-content" class="bg-grau"><div id="footer"><div class="row"><div class="medium-6 large-5 columns"><h5 class="shadow-grey">About This Site</h5><p class="shadow-grey"> InnerSource applies the lessons of Open Source to all software engineering, using collaboration and transparency to increase quality, speed, and developer joy <a href="/getting-started/">More ›</a></div><div class="small-6 medium-3 large-3 large-offset-1 columns"><h5 class="shadow-grey">Services</h5><ul class="no-bullet shadow-grey"><li > <a href="" title=""></a><li > <a href="/contact/" title="Contact">Contact</a><li > <a href="/feed.xml" title="Subscribe to RSS Feed">RSS</a><li > <a href="/atom.xml" title="Subscribe to Atom Feed">Atom</a><li > <a href="/sitemap.xml" title="Sitemap for Google Webmaster Tools">sitemap.xml</a></ul></div><div class="small-6 medium-3 large-3 columns"><h5 class="shadow-grey">Dankeschön</h5><ul class="no-bullet shadow-grey"><li > <a href="" title=""></a><li class="network-entypo" > <a href="http://entypo.com/" target="_blank" title="Icons by Daniel Bruce">Icons by Daniel Bruce</a><li class="services-newsletter" > <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank" title="Built on Foundation">Built on Foundation</a><li class="rss-link" > <a href="http://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" title="Images by Unsplash">Images by Unsplash</a><li class="sitemap-link" > <a href="http://srobbin.com/jquery-plugins/backstretch/" target="_blank" title="Using Backstretch by Scott Robbin">Using Backstretch by Scott Robbin</a><li > <a href="http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/" target="_blank" title="Feeling Responsive theme by Phlow">Feeling Responsive theme by Phlow</a><li > <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" title="Hosting by GitHub Pages">Hosting by GitHub Pages</a></ul></div></div></div><div id="subfooter"><nav class="row"><section id="subfooter-left" class="small-12 medium-6 columns credits"><p>Maintained by the InnerSource community.
