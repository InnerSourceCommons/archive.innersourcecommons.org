    <b>Russell Green</b>
    <p>
Russell currently leads Deutsche Bank’s (DB) Group Architecture function, where he is responsible for ensuring that the bank’s architecture practice is comprehensive, operational and efficient. 
 
This includes co-ordinating the group-wide architecture roadmap, ensuring an effective governance process for programmes and technology and developing the architecture foundations that underpin the strategy. Group Architecture also plays a central role in articulating the current technology landscape and measuring progress towards DB’s target state.
 
Russell chairs a number of key forums that define the future direction of DB’s IT practice. These include the Global CTO Council, which oversees the operational and future state of DBs architecture practice; the Technology Architecture Council (TAC), which controls the organisation’s technology portfolio and the Open Source Review Council, which oversees the bank’s engagement with the global open source community. 
 
Russell joined DB in 2015 as CTO for the Control Functions, where he established the architecture control practice and led work to define the target state. 
Prior to DB, he has spent over 15 years in various architecture roles across the banking sector including LCH, UBS, Barclays and most recently RBC. Before moving into financial services, Russell developed high performance billing applications for the telecoms industry. 
 
Russell attained his PhD from Imperial College in 1994 and this expertise forms the basis of his analytical approach to architecture and knowledge management. He believes that the establishment of a world class architecture function is needed to enable global organisations such as DB to execute in a coordinated and efficient manner.

    <b>Brittany Erica Istenes</b>
    <p>
Brittany started off her career as an elementary/special education school teacher in a lower income area of Philadelphia. 
Seeing the need for a stronger technology presence in education, she transitioned from the classroom for a company that 
specialized in getting students from lower income areas all across the country to read at or above grade level through 
teaching teachers all across the country how to use online tools that track and assist getting students to meet their goals. 
Now at Comcast, one of her main focuses is the delivery of OSS through the company and beyond as well as a a sharp focus on Community. 
She guides the Open Source Advisory Council which is comprised of compliance lawyers, patent/strategic IP lawyers, engineers and security to 
evaluate all Open Source contributions and new projects that come through the company. Some other projects she works on is the 
Open Source Ambassador program which takes technologists from all over the company and guides them through the OSS process to become 
evangels for what we do within and outside of the company. Another is the Open Source Fellowship program which focuses on getting developers 
to dedicate 25% of their year on Open Source Software tooling.  Finally Brittany sits on the newly formed internal InnerSource Guild which guides 
teams through best InnerSource practices.
