In a multinational software corporation like SAP, that has recently grown to almost a hundred thousand employees, reuse and efficient collaboration across organizational borders is quite a challenge. Our development organization spreads across the globe and our products are implemented on a large variety of technology stacks. How can we establish an efficient development process and a collaboration culture at the same time? 

As we transform into a cloud company, we leverage open standards and open source components in our products. We also create technology frameworks and tools that we share with the community. Also, we are a strong and diverse community of developers inside the company. Collaboration happens quite naturally because we identify synergies or have a similar challenge to solve – sometimes without knowing that we are doing InnerSource.

On larger scale, InnerSource establishes well-aligned architectures, maximizes reuse, and avoids organizational silos. It allows to share not only code, but also architectural patterns, data models, learning material, knowledge and experiences, as well as documentation across organizational borders. And it can also be an incubator for open source. Therefore, it is important to promote and facilitate the adoption of InnerSource across the company. 

Along practical examples, we share our journey towards InnerSource and how we are growing a collaboration culture based on open source methodology in our development organization.

The modern IT consists of constant transformations, product and feature teams, a large number of engineers, plenty of new roles and many business units that solve similar business cases every day. The complexity of business requires modern approaches in development and mature engineering culture. The choice to adopt InnerSource can cover most of the business needs. Usually, InnerSource adoption grows from a small experimental team. But what if to roll these principles to all teams and companies in the group at once? This talk will show our experience and key findings after one year of movement.

Wide-scale adoption of InnerSource is a state that can feel so close yet many times is so far. It's a culture change that must be won a single person at a time until the whole organization has shifted. This type of broad-scale impact is hard and often fizzles before achieving its full potential. What can help to drive this type of initiative to completion? Data. Reliable, cheap, accessible data shows how far you've come and where it makes sense to go next. This insight imbues energy to keep your culture change initiative going past an initial flare-up.

Unfortunately, it's not easy to get the data that you need to inform your InnerSource program. In this presentation we'll review what we've done at Nike with data for InnerSource. We'll explain our requirements in choosing a data platform and what scenarios and questions it has enabled and will enable. We'll take a peek at how early prototypes are being used and also outline our future plans in both the near and long term.

We all agree that communities, and specially software development communities, are about people building technology. No matter if they are involved in open source or innersource projects. So, any step to understand any software development community requires to understand the people involve in it. Internal DevRel people are needed, and the work to connect with the community members is key. How to do it efficiently given the diversity of infrastructures used by community members to participate and contribute in any community?

In business and sales, another area were relationship with people is key, there is a solution that has probed to work: CRM (Customers Relationship Management) software. And from time to time, similar approach has been used with community members: people that might end "buying" or "engaged" with certain technology or project. This similarity is also related with the fact that in many organizations, DevRel people are under Marketing department, and they are measured by marketing and sales goals. But, are sales and marketing engagement the real value that DevRel people bring to an organization?

Is this mindset right? Honestly, I am not 100% sure. During this talk I would like showcasing how existing open source tools could be used to create, and perhaps feed, a CRM (or some short of), but with a mid shift: "C stands for Community".

The BBC’s Connected TV client powers the iPlayer, Sport, News, and RedButton+ products, and is maintained by 6 development teams. In order to work together effectively on a single codebase, an InnerSource approach was adopted. This case study shows how this was implemented and evolved over time.

This case study will start with the background of the problem. How did the BBC end up with a monolithic client that was a huge source of FUD for developers working on it? What sort of problems were they facing day by day when developing on it? What could be done to alleviate the FUD of working on this client, and re-enable innovation and rapid development in their products?

After your decision that Inner Source is the way to go for your company, you will inevitably face the next challenge: Just how do you get people from other departments involved in your project? How do you attract contributions from outside of your core team? How do you convey that your project is worth their time? In other words: How do you build a community who cares? 

At Daimler TSS, we are in the process of learning our lessons. Let me share with you some of the ingredients of successful internal community building, illustrated with the example of two of our first cool Inner Source projects. And also, let me show you how a Terminator can help you to change your company’s future.

InnerSource is the application of open source methodologies to internally-developed software. While simple to define, InnerSource can be difficult to explain and implement successfully. Many engineers lack background in open source and the ideas and mechanics of open code development. Even those with that background face a new set of constraints and motivations when trying to work openly within the enterprise. The InnerSource Commons Learning Path gives a simple, easy to understand introduction to inner source. It introduces key terms, concepts, and principles for effective application of InnerSource along with explanations and real examples. It is intended to bring newcomers up to speed as well as provide those with experience a common vocabulary to use when discussing more advanced concepts. The InnerSource Commons Learning path will be freely hosted on the InnerSource Commons website and at the O'Reilly media learning platform. In this session we'll review the content of the learning path and how you can use and share it.

Digital transformation is the process through which organizations learn to break free from over-complicated constraints and learn to accept and leverage their internal complexity. Many technologies and methodologies exist that contribute to that transformation, but individually they often fail to deliver a true transformation. InnerSourcing can play a key role in interlinking these strategies and the people that execute them to help companies to catalyze a phase change in an organization's behavior. In this talk I will discuss 5 objectives that help companies become complex adaptive systems, and how Innersourcing initiatives can contribute to them.

InnerSource and open source share common roots and are based on the same fundamental ideas, but they're not the same. Georg Grütter sheds light on the differences and makes a case for why both have a place in the world of software development.

Open source has been around for a long time now. Its success has led to and lends credibility to the growing practice of InnerSource. Despite being around for over 15 years, there are still a lot of misconceptions about InnerSource, many of which revolve around its relation to open source.

Georg Grütter examines the main differences between InnerSource and open source and discusses if InnerSource even has a place in a world in which open source is becoming more and more prevalent. You’ll explore if InnerSource creates more problems than it solves and if all InnerSource initiatives will eventually lead to open source, anyway. Georg explains how an open source practice differs from an InnerSource practice, all to make a case for InnerSource in an open source-dominated world.

Thales Inner Source Software (TISS) Community is born from the Thales Digital Transformation call for initiatives in 2016. As a major differentiator with previous attempt to promote source code sharing and reuse, it has been designed from the beginning to tackle key aspects of the Open collaboration: legal, tools and cultural change. Today, this community is organized like an “internal” open source foundation and is continuously growing within the company. Thales, as a provider of complex and critical systems is now identifying new opportunities related to the adoption of Open Source best practices: Open Hardware and Open Data are now opening the door to Inner Hardware and Inner Data.

API developer portals are a self-service hub, a documentation database, a mission control platform, and a trust signal. All these concepts also apply to innersource developer portals. In my fall presentation I explained how the lessons learnt —while creating external API developer portals— can be applied to create an innersource devportal template. I also focused on how these innersource portals can be extended with features and UX patterns built to address the most important innersourcing patterns. 
Now, I would like to present the results of the work we have done together with some members of the community: the connection between the steps of the upstream developer journey and innersource patterns, the personas, the main functional/content elements, a sitemap and some wireframes for innersource devportal pages.

The role of DevRel has been key to spread corporation's technologies through engaged communities all around the World. DevRel programs are targeted to engage users and contributors to the communities they manage.

During this talk we will show the value of DevRel within InnerSource ecosystems, and how they can help to enhance the main InnerSource pillars: collaboration, transparency, and community.

Project managers, InnerSource advocates, and of course, DevRels are welcome to this talk, either to learn more about how DevRel people can help InnerSource initiatives to succeed, or to check for new job opportunities for DevRels

BBC iPlayer is the BBC’s UK internet TV offering, providing live channels and video-on-demand across all the major platforms. Developed internally, it has seen massive growth in the last 5 years, both in terms of usage and the size of the development team. Our department is now over 30 development teams, and we work with (and for) other teams and departments across the BBC. As we have scaled, we discovered that our existing focus on localised speed and autonomy results in isolation, duplicated work, friction between teams, and narrow innovation. We have been exploring models of collaboration for a number of years now to break down silos and encourage teams to contribute collectively to the bigger opportunities and shared problems.

We have established a wide toolbox of collaborative approaches, from guilds and communities, to operational models, to open development practices such as open source and InnerSource. Steph and David will be sharing the learnings from 5 years of breaking down silos and getting teams to talk.

InnerSource takes successful working patterns from open source and applies them to company-internal software development. Internal projects, run in this open, collaborative fashion, unlock developer creativity and efficiency. They balance the needs from multiple parts of the company and reduce siloed, duplicative work. They foster a dynamic, fulfilling work environment.

In this presentation, we'll explore how to go about introducing an InnerSource working model within your company from the ground up. We'll look at published patterns of introducing such a culture change and give real-life anecdotes of how those patterns have played out at Nike. We'll also review the scientific underpinnings of why these patterns work, all in a fun and engaging way with memorable examples. At the end of the presentation you'll leave with a mental guide of principles to follow in bringing InnerSource behavior to software development inside your company.

In this Birds-Of-A-Feather style interactive session, we'll explore topics crucial to Inner Source culture, including:
(a) whether your organisation's current cultural values and established beliefs are a good fit for the ways of working required for Inner Source;
(b) how to get more employees to collaborate on Inner Source projects that are not part of their specific responsibility;
(c) using perceived negative cultural traits such as competitiveness and control to your advantage.
This session offers an opportunity to participate in the conversation by asking your own questions about Inner Source culture, sharing insights and experiences, hearing what's worked well for other organisations, and getting to know others in Inner Source. Dive in and join the conversation, or just sit back, observe, and listen.d

InnerSource adoption in your organization cannot happen magically by itself. Fear not! There are proven best practices you can follow to adopt InnerSource and run a successful program at your company. In the InnerSource Commons, we document such best practices in the form of InnerSource patterns. A pattern is a structured description of a repeatable and proven solution to a specific problem. This talk introduces the concept and format of patterns, presents a selection of the current (and growing) set of InnerSource patterns, and enables you to formulate best practices you know in the pattern format.
During the breakout groups following this talk, we are certain you can apply your new knowledge on patterns: If you are discussing a solution to a common problem, why not formulate it as a pattern and submit it to github.com/innersourcecommons/innersourcepatterns?
