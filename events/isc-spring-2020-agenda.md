In a multinational software corporation like SAP, that has recently grown to almost a hundred thousand employees, reuse and efficient collaboration across organizational borders is quite a challenge. Our development organization spreads across the globe and our products are implemented on a large variety of technology stacks. How can we establish an efficient development process and a collaboration culture at the same time? 

As we transform into a cloud company, we leverage open standards and open source components in our products. We also create technology frameworks and tools that we share with the community. Also, we are a strong and diverse community of developers inside the company. Collaboration happens quite naturally because we identify synergies or have a similar challenge to solve – sometimes without knowing that we are doing InnerSource.

On larger scale, InnerSource establishes well-aligned architectures, maximizes reuse, and avoids organizational silos. It allows to share not only code, but also architectural patterns, data models, learning material, knowledge and experiences, as well as documentation across organizational borders. And it can also be an incubator for open source. Therefore, it is important to promote and facilitate the adoption of InnerSource across the company. 

Along practical examples, we share our journey towards InnerSource and how we are growing a collaboration culture based on open source methodology in our development organization.

The modern IT consists of constant transformations, product and feature teams, a large number of engineers, plenty of new roles and many business units that solve similar business cases every day. The complexity of business requires modern approaches in development and mature engineering culture. The choice to adopt InnerSource can cover most of the business needs. Usually, InnerSource adoption grows from a small experimental team. But what if to roll these principles to all teams and companies in the group at once? This talk will show our experience and key findings after one year of movement.

In this talk, we'll explore topics crucial to Inner Source culture, including:
    (a) whether your organisation's current cultural values and established beliefs are a good fit for the ways of working required for Inner Source; 
    (b) how to get more employees to collaborate on Inner Source projects that are not part of their specific responsibility; 
    (c) using perceived negative cultural traits such as competitiveness and control to your advantage.

This session offers an opportunity to participate in the conversation by asking your own questions about Inner Source culture, sharing insights and experiences, hearing what's worked well for other organisations, and getting to know others in Inner Source. Dive in and join the conversation, or just sit back, observe, and listen.

InnerSource adoption in your organization cannot happen magically by itself. Fear not! There are proven best practices you can follow to adopt InnerSource and run a successful program at your company. In the InnerSource Commons, we document such best practices in the form of InnerSource patterns. A pattern is a structured description of a repeatable and proven solution to a specific problem. This talk introduces the concept and format of patterns, presents a selection of the current (and growing) set of InnerSource patterns, and enables you to formulate best practices you know in the pattern format.
During the breakout groups following this talk, we are certain you can apply your new knowledge on patterns: If you are discussing a solution to a common problem, why not formulate it as a pattern and submit it to github.com/innersourcecommons/innersourcepatterns?

            <span onClick="toggleAbstract('vantomme-1')" class="abstract-toggle">(<a id="vantomme-1-link">Show Abstract</a>)</span>
            <div style="display:none" class="abstract" id="vantomme-1">
Digital transformation is the process through which organizations learn to break free from over-complicated constraints and learn to accept and leverage their internal complexity. Many technologies and methodologies exist that contribute to that transformation, but individually they often fail to deliver a true transformation. InnerSourcing can play a key role in interlinking these strategies and the people that execute them to help companies to catalyze a phase change in an organization's behavior. In this talk I will discuss 5 objectives that help companies become complex adaptive systems, and how Innersourcing initiatives can contribute to them.

Unlike OpenSource, InnerSource is still a new thing in china. But several big companies already adopted InnerSource including Baidu. As the program manager of InnerSource in Baidu, I will talk about the journey of InnerSource in Baidu, from its first stage, then moved to the next, then next,  how I set policy, process and utility tools to support it. and I will introduce some other company's practice in China  as well.

The role of DevRel has been key to spread corporation's technologies through engaged communities all around the World. DevRel programs are targeted to engage users and contributors to the communities they manage.

During this talk we will show the value of DevRel within InnerSource ecosystems, and how they can help to enhance the main InnerSource pillars: collaboration, transparency, and community.

Project managers, InnerSource advocates, and of course, DevRels are welcome to this talk, either to learn more about how DevRel people can help InnerSource initiatives to succeed, or to check for new job opportunities for DevRels

The BBC’s Connected TV client powers the iPlayer, Sport, News, and RedButton+ products, and is maintained by 6 development teams. In order to work together effectively on a single codebase, an InnerSource approach was adopted. This case study shows how this was implemented and evolved over time.

This case study will start with the background of the problem. How did the BBC end up with a monolithic client that was a huge source of FUD for developers working on it? What sort of problems were they facing day by day when developing on it? What could be done to alleviate the FUD of working on this client, and re-enable innovation and rapid development in their products?

InnerSource and open source share common roots and are based on the same fundamental ideas, but they're not the same. Georg Grütter sheds light on the differences and makes a case for why both have a place in the world of software development.

Open source has been around for a long time now. Its success has led to and lends credibility to the growing practice of InnerSource. Despite being around for over 15 years, there are still a lot of misconceptions about InnerSource, many of which revolve around its relation to open source.

Georg Grütter examines the main differences between InnerSource and open source and discusses if InnerSource even has a place in a world in which open source is becoming more and more prevalent. You’ll explore if InnerSource creates more problems than it solves and if all InnerSource initiatives will eventually lead to open source, anyway. Georg explains how an open source practice differs from an InnerSource practice, all to make a case for InnerSource in an open source-dominated world.
