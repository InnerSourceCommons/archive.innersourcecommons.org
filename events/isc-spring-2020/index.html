<p>Welcome to the 10th InnerSource Commons taking place in <em>your living room</em>! ;) We’re going virtual - see details below. Latest update: all the summit talks are now available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCH-i0B0otNQeYBH5QvNRBDA3CMrS9lL9">InnerSource Commons YouTube channel</a>!</p>

<p>We are all exploring new ways to get together and keep advancing in the body of knowledge of InnerSource. Nowadays and in this industry, it is more and more important to successfully work remotely and across different geographical areas. This online event has this in mind and we hope to learn from each other, what it is working and what it is not.</p>

<p>These two days will be a three hours slot taking place from 4 pm CET till 7 pm Central European Time, / 9 am and noon Central Time / 7 am and 10 am Pacific Time / 10 pm and 1 am China Standard Time.</p>

<p>The day will be split as a sandwich, where talks will be the bread and discussions the <em>yummi yummi</em> part. We are expecting to have two keynotes per day (up to 25 minutes each), and four lightning talks (up to 15 minutes each). These will be initially pre-recorded and discussions will take place in the InnerSource Commons Slack. Right in the middle we will have a break and two breakout sessions with live interactions.</p>

<p>We’re planning to have a contest as well as icebreaker during the first moments of this, do not miss this!</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-and-innersource-commons-current-status">COVID-19 and InnerSource Commons current Status</h3>

<p>As of now, the InnerSource Commons Madrid Summit is taking place.
However, not in Madrid, Spain.</p>

<p>The current situation as you all know has quickly evolved and we all need to be socially responsible.
Our first priority is the safety of everyone and we have decided to celebrate the April meeting as a <em>virtual</em> meeting where we all can keep collaborating, and learning from each other.</p>

<p>If you have already registered and paid for the ticket entry, you have several options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do a refunding as soon as we get notified by you.</li>
  <li>You are still interested in participating. For this, we would like to ask you to support the InnerSource Commons. We ask for a small fee and you will get a t-shirt and some stickers.</li>
  <li>If you already bought a ticket with the higher fee, you can donate the difference of ~20EUR to the InnerSource Commons. In this case: Thank you!</li>
  <li>If you already bought a ticket with the higher fee, you can also get a partial refund of the difference.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4450343">Registration</a> is already open! We are using Brown Paper Tickets for this process. Please notice that <strong>taxes</strong> will be added on top of the sales process.

<h3 id="what-is-the-innersource-commons">What is the InnerSource Commons?</h3>

<p>The InnerSource Commons (<a href="http://innersourcecommons.org">InnerSourceCommons.org</a>) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-attend">Who should attend?</h3>

<p>The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-i-get-from-this-event">What will I get from this event?</h3>

<p>The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption</li>
  <li>Share your experiences and get help with your challenges</li>
  <li>Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="venue">Venue</h3>

<p>The summit is hosted online. Instructions will be provided to all speakers and attendees.</p>

<h3 id="call-for-sponsorship">Call For Sponsorship</h3>
