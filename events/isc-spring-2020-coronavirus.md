### COVID-19 and InnerSource Commons Events

**Update (March 5, 2020)**. The InnerSource Commons takes very seriously the current coronavirus situation and the safety of all of the participants. We are following recommended guidelines from the Spanish Government Health Ministry (SGHM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The InnerSource Commons Spring Summit is taking place on the 14th-16th April 2020, Madrid, Spain. And we are taking into account several recommendations aligned with the SGHM and WHO and acordding to the following map referring to [areas of risk (marked as red, yellow and green)](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/areas.htm). There are recommendations suggested by the [Spanish government](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Recomendaciones_regreso_area_riesgo.pdf) for those coming from these areas. Both of these documents are in Spanish, but they're following the WHO general recommendations.

There is a specific [notification](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/sanidadExterior/salud/pdf/CARTEL_INGLES_CORONAVIRUS_COVID_19_02.pdf) (English) for travelers arriving from affected areas.

If you're coming from any of these areas, please contact us (as for instance dizquierdo at bitergia dot com) to consider or not your attendance.
