### COVID-19 and InnerSource Commons Events

This event has moved to a virtual one. Everyone is welcome to join. More information at the [InnerSource Commons Madrid Summit site](http://innersourcecommons.org/events/isc-spring-2020/).




For planning and conducting the summit, we are taking into account the SGHM and WHO general recommendations. Specifically, we use a [list of recommendations](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Recomendaciones_regreso_area_riesgo.pdf) compiled by the Spanish government based on a map of [areas of risk](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/areas.htm) (marked as red, yellow, and green).

*For attendees* there is a specific [notification](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/sanidadExterior/salud/pdf/CARTEL_INGLES_CORONAVIRUS_COVID_19_02.pdf) (English) for travelers arriving from affected areas.

If you are residing in on of these risk areas or will travel there in the period before the summit, please contact us (for instance Daniel at `dizquierdo at bitergia dot com`) and we can jointly work out a solution for your attendance or - if not possible - virtual presence at the summit.

In addition to this, the InnerSource Commons will take the following actions:

Before the event takes place:
* We will keep updating the information about the outbreak and keep informing you, as well as updating if needes specific actions required.
