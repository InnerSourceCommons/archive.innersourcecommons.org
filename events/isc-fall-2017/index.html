Who are the Speakers?

See the list of speakers

What is InnerSource?
InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. As developers have become accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that companies may be reluctant to release. For companies building mostly closed source software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to contribute software back to the open source world.

What is the InnerSource Commons?
The InnerSource Commons (InnerSourceCommons.org) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over sixty companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the Chatham House Rule), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.

Who should attend?
The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.

What will I get from this event?
The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:


  Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption
  Share your experiences and get help with your challenges
  Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!


Venue

This Summit is hosted by Nokia at their facility at 1960 W. Lucent Lane, Naperville, IL 60563-1594. The venue spaces there reserved for the Fall Summit include a flexible, large auditorium, four break-out rooms and an on-site cafeteria.

Area Highlights

The city of Naperville is a suburb of Chicago, located about forty minutes west of the Chicago downtown and about forty minutes away from the O’Hare International Airport. It was ranked among the nation’s safest cities by USAToday and Business Insider. Naperville was voted the second-best place to live in the United States by Money magazine in 2006. It was rated 1st on the list of best cities for early retirement in 2013 by Kiplinger. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 141,853, which was estimated to have increased to 147,100 by July 2015. It is the fifth-largest city in Illinois.

Downtown Naperville features its own riverwalk, created in 1981 to celebrate the city’s Sesquicentennial (150th anniversary). The park features covered bridges, relaxing fountains and distinctive shepherd’s crook lights.

<p>See <a href="/events/isc-fall-2017-speakers">the list of speakers</a></p>

<h3 id="what-is-innersource">What is InnerSource?</h3>
<p>InnerSource takes the lessons learned from developing open source software and applies them to the way companies develop software internally. As developers have become accustomed to working on world class open source software, there is a strong desire to bring those practices back inside the firewall and apply them to software that companies may be reluctant to release. For companies building mostly closed source software, InnerSource can be a great tool to help break down silos, encourage internal collaboration, accelerate new engineer on-boarding, and identify opportunities to contribute software back to the open source world.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-innersource-commons">What is the InnerSource Commons?</h3>
<p>The InnerSource Commons (<a href="http://innersourcecommons.org">InnerSourceCommons.org</a>) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over sixty companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-attend">Who should attend?</h3>
<p>The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-i-get-from-this-event">What will I get from this event?</h3>
<p>The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption</li>
  <li>Share your experiences and get help with your challenges</li>
  <li>Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="venue">Venue</h3>

<p>This Summit is hosted by <a href="http://www.nokia.com/en_int">Nokia</a> at their facility at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cYHJb2jLb1m">1960 W. Lucent Lane, Naperville, IL 60563-1594</a>.
