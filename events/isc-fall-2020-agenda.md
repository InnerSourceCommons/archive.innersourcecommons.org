InnerSource is more than telling someone the mechanics of code and community management. It is a culture change that needs to be nurtured and supported. Like all culture change, it can be encouraged from the top-down but grows out of energy from the bottom up. How can we foster real InnerSource culture change at an enterprise-wide scale Come and see how we work at Nike to create an culture ripe for InnerSource and leverage data to scale that culture company-wide.

We recently applied the Project Portal pattern at SAP to ease discovery of InnerSource projects for our internal community. In this session, we will share our experiences on applying InnerSourceCommons patterns and the unexpected synergies along the way. And we will show the new portal, of course!
<br>
When we started applying the pattern we spotted some new challenges:
(a) How can we efficiently crawl InnerSource projects from various sources and merge them into one source? Projects may be located in GitHub Enterprise, Git/Gerrit, or ABAP systems,
(b) In which order shall we present the results? Is there a way to show the most active and promising projects to the community first? How can we automatically measure and track the activity of an InnerSource project?,
(c)  Which metadata should be provided by project owners to list skills and needs for potential contributors? How can they be presented in the Project Portal?
<br>
We solved them the InnerSource way:
With creative collaboration across organizational borders and by sharing our experiences with the InnerSourceCommons community. We ended up with two new InnerSource projects and a backlog of new ideas. As a side-project we even drafted a new pattern to rank InnerSource projects - the InnerSource Activity Score

What good is source code sitting a repo? No much, might as well be ideas on the back of a napkin. In this session I present the 18 month journey of design implementing and operating a development pipeline within classic government organization stuck on legacy technologies, business process spaghetti and data stuffed into silos. The solution is a mix of open source software, open software development and of course a DevOps pipeline to move code from repos to production at lightening speed.

In 2020 a lot of companies moved to a remote first setting in a hurry - and with varying success. In this talk we will look deeper into what types of communication happen in-office, how to transform those in a remote-first environment. We will see just how much can be transformed. A lot of the emerging patterns have been applied successfully within Open Source projects for decades. We will see how with a combination InnerSource patterns and Open Organization principles these practices can help organizations move to more transparency, faster innovation - all the while providing a lot of opportunities for junior developers to learn from their peers by watching over their shoulders.

Many InnerSource practitioners have spoken about how InnerSource can be a great pathway to open source development. However, there are many different reasons why organizations begin their InnerSource journey.  The benefits can be wide-reaching and varied. This session looks at some of the most common reasons individuals and groups start InnerSourcing, and how to start building a case for more InnerSourcerers at your company.

InnerSource leverages Open Source practices internally to enable collaboration, and Requests for Comments (RFCs) are no exception. This talk explores how BBC iPlayer & Sounds adopted RFCs to scale up collaborative decision making, and empower teams and individuals to make an impact outside their organisational silos.

Many companies approach Inner Source from the collaboration point of view only. But that internal collaboration makes more sense if it also leads to higher levels of efficiency when developing and delivering software. So in addition to define metrics  that evaluate that collaboration, metrics focused on software delivery should be applied too.

The goal of the talk is to introduce the audience in such software delivery process performance metrics as well as how to implement them. Agustín will also relate them with some of the metrics designed to evaluate collaboration in an Inner Source context.

A seismic shift has occurred across open source ecosystems that has given rise to more "connected strategies" of community development efforts and improved models for cross-ecosystem engagement. To paraphrase Leonard Cohen, “There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.”  The new virtual reality we live in has created opportunities for more open innovative community collaboration, introduced new ways of connecting end users, enterprises, and open source initiatives. The new world that we've awoken to is now one of continous connection.  In this keynote, Diane Mueller will discuss how to leverage these new connected strategies, emerging trends towards 'virtuous' cycle of collaboration between end users, vendors, enterprises and open source initiatives that has emerged as a result, and how to bring this new model and strategies,  values and ways of connecting and collaborating both internally (InnerSource), externally (Open Source) to your organizations' development efforts.
