### 2nd and 3rd December 2020, online - [register now](https://eventyay.com/e/3dbaaa50)!

Welcome to the 12th InnerSource Commons Summit! Thanks to the success of the <a href="https://youtu.be/0YzOz94cNec">ISC
Online Fall Summit 2020</a>, we are staying online for our first summit timed for our growing APAC community.

We continue to explore new ways to get together and keep advancing in the body of knowledge of InnerSource. Nowadays, particularly in this industry, it
is more important than ever to successfully work remotely and across different geographical areas. This online event has this in mind and we hope to learn from
each other, what it is working and what it is not.

Check out our full list of speakers [here](/events/isc-apac-2020-speakers/).

### About the Event

The summit consists of two days, each a 3 hour slot: running from 10:30 IST / 13:00 SGT & CST / 16:00 AEDT (5am UTC).

This is our first summit planned for our APAC audience, so the schedule is planned with that in mind, but we welcome participants from all over the world.

### Call For Sponsorship

We invite interested organisations and companies to sponsor our summits.

### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.

### Who should attend?

The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer. The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organizationâ€”whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.

### What will I get from this event?

The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:

* Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption
* Share your experiences and get help with your challenges
* Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!
