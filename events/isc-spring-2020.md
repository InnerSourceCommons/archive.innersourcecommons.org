title: 'InnerSource Commons Spring Summit 2020'
---
### 14th to 16th April 2020 in Madrid, Spain

Welcome to the 10th InnerSource Commons taking place in *your living room*! ;) We're going virtual! See details below and watch this space for updates!

### COVID-19 and InnerSource Commons current Status

As of now, the InnerSource Commons Madrid Summit is taking place.
However, not in Madrid, Spain.

First of all, apologies for the delayed update.

The current situation as you all know has quickly evolved and we all need to be socially responsible.
Our first priority is the safety of everyone and we have decided to celebrate the April meeting as a *virtual* meeting where we all can keep collaborating, and learning from each other.

With this new way of proceeding in mind, we would like to know from your side, if you're willing to participate at the InnerSource Commons in a virtual way.

We are still discussing about the format, but we can promise i*we'll do our best to foster networking, collaboration*, and explore new ways to run a conference as this one, full of great discussions and insights.

Some questions from our side:
* If you are a speaker, would you participate in this new format? 
* As you're an attendee, would you be willing to attend online talks and open discussions?

There are still a lot of open questions we're trying to resolve as soon as possible. These go from the infrastructure to use, how to record presentations (in the case we are), if speakers will present live or recorded.

Finally, if you have already registered and paid for the ticket entry, *we'll do a refund as soon as the provider allows us* to proceed.

### Registration

[Registration](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4450343) is already open! We are using Brown Paper Tickets for this process. Please notice that **taxes** will be added on top of the sales process.

Please consider registering early as this helps us to organize and have everyone's needs in mind.

### What is the InnerSource Commons?

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.
  
### Who should attend?

The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.
   
### What will I get from this event?

The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:

* Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption
* Share your experiences and get help with your challenges
* Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!
